            <h2 class="headline headline--no-t-margin">Here&rsquo;s a quick version of my backstory&hellip;</h2>
            <p>I was born in Maryland, where I grew up and lived until I graduated high school. I have always loved to play sports. My dad got me active in sports from a young age and he coached my little league baseball team for a few years along with my uncle. I played basketball and baseball as a kid and transitioned to football one I was 12 or so. I always continued to play basketball in my spare time, and still do to this day. As a matter of fact, as I write this, my knees are a bit sore from playing last night.</p>
            <p>I've always been curious when it comes to computers and technology. Ever since my pre-teen years, I had a fascination with the power of computers and I would lose myself in this "other world" -- exploring whatever rabbithole I had most recently fell into. These ranged from P2P technology, programming, encrypted communications, software exploits, server administration, etc. When my junior year of high school came around, I got a call from a football coach in South Dakota who wanted to recruit me to his school -- an engineering school. This was the only engineering school that was recruiting me, and I felt at home when I went to visit the campus and saw kids who truly loved technology. Some would call them nerds. I learned that <s>they</s> we were engineers... a distinct type of person that I hadn't really been exposed to up until this point in my life. I ended up attending that school, playing football, and earning my degree.<p>
            <p>I had an internship along the way, got a job at a large tech company out of college, and worked there for 1.5 years before I was overcome with wanderlust (more on all of this below). Long story short, I'm at a point in my (nascent) career where I'm making a bit of a shift in focus toward being a full-time web developer. I've built this page to show off some of my capabilities and to share a bit about myself. I hope that you find it informative :)

            <p>By default, this page is built for mobile devices with small displays. A look at the source code will shows that media query mixins (leveraging the PostCSS 'mixins' package) are used so that upon encountering a "small" (defined here as having a width of > 530px), medium (> 800px) or "large" (> 1010px) screen, the CSS fed to the browser will be modified in order to accomodate. Over 50% of global web traffic comes from mobile devices, and this figure is on the rise. Please feel free to view this page from your mobile device(s) and/or reshape your browser window to see how the page responds!</p>

            <h3 class="feature-item__title">Minimal Data Usage</h3>
            <p>This page also features "responsive images", meaning that the server is hosting multiple versions of some images (e.g. the ocean-side cover image), and sending you the highest-quality version that your screen can display without sending one that contains un-displayable pixels. If you resize your browser, clear your cache, and 'inspect element' on the cover image, you will see that you are being sent the appropriate file each time. Additionally, the CSS and JS files hosted on the server are compressed and revisioned during the build process.</p>

            <span class="icon icon--fire feature-item__icon"></span>
            <h3 class="feature-item__title">Blazing Fast Page Loads</h3>
            <p>In addition to responsive images, this page also utilizes a "lazy image loading" feature which means that when you first load the page, the server will only send your browser the image data which you are able to view immediately. As you scroll down the page and reach the other sections, your browser will then receive the image data necessary to display these sections. This allows for the user to only ever download data which they require. This was implemented with the Node.js 'Waypoints' and 'lazysizes' packages. <p>

            <h3 class="feature-item__title">Clean, Reusable Code</h3>
            <p>Please take a peak at the source code for this page. As a matter of fact, feel free to conduct a thorough investigation! You will see that the CSS and JavaScript under-the-hood have been organized in a manner which allows for anyone to make a quick contribution, completely take over the reigns, or anything in-between. I've utilized the BEM methodology which allows for relatively easy long-term support. The CSS and JS are funneled through a number of gulp packages which allow for rapid development/testing and well-organized, lightweight source files being delivered to the end-user. The JS is modular, object-oriented, reusable, and I hope that you find it easily understandable. </p>

            <h4 class="testimonial__subtitle">2015</h4>
            <p>Nexus (now 'ebb') was a startup company which allowed people to link their fingerprint to their bank account and 'pay with their finger' at participating merchants throughout the city. During my time in college, I worked as a part-time intern during my junior and senior years and as a full-time employee during that summer. I wore many hats during my time with the company. I started out by spending my first 3 weeks soldering hundreds of wireless antennas to circuit boards. After that, I was (very quickly!) trained to be the company "field technician", meaning I was responsible for installing, maintaining and troubleshooting our payment terminals at 50+ merchant locations throughout the city.</p>
            <p>Eventually, the company brought on a full-time employee to take over my position. I trained him over the course of a few weeks. Once he had taken over my responsibilities, the company transitioned me into a junior software developer role. I worked directly under two incredibly talented developers and this is when I really began to get a feel for what it takes to get software out into production and the importance of adherence to best-practices and inter-team communication, including between devs and management.</p>

            <h4 class="testimonial__subtitle">2016-2017</h4>
            <p>Upon graduation, I had an offer from EchoStar (now part of DISH) for a full-time software engineering position in Denver, CO. Many of the skills that I used and developed during my time at Nexus transferred over. I worked very closely with our company partner and CPU manufacturer Broadcom to implement the "hardware abstraction layer" which allowed other software teams to easily and reliably access chip functionality such as streaming video data, switching streams, capturing streams, and managing Bluetooth functionality.</p>
            <p>I also worked closely with a company partner 'TVGuardian' to maintain and develop features for their app which ran on DISH set-top boxes. The software that I wrote during my time with EchoStar was deployed to 1 million+ subscribers and continues to run today.</p>
            <p>During my time at EchoStar/DISH, things like version control, linux and the command line, scripting, and code reviews became second-nature. Specifically, we utilized the ClearCase version control system, Ubuntu Linux and bash, JIRA, Mantis, and on any given day I may be required to interpret .js, .xml, .sh, .c, .cpp, and/or .py files -- and anything else that may live in a 20+ year-old codebase with millions of lines of code.</p>

            <h4 class="testimonial__subtitle">A Lifelong Passion of Mine</h4>
            <p>I've always enjoyed helping friends and peers with their studies informally. This has been something that I've done on and off ever since middle school. I've held a handful of official tutoring positions over the past decade or so, including working as a math tutor during high school, working for my school as a math/computer science tutor in college, and working with a national company (Club-Z) during my time in Denver during which I tutored middle/high school students in math, science, and especially in test-prep for the ACT. I also dipped my toes into the ever-expanding field of online education in 2016 by creating a Udemy course focused on the Raspberry Pi which has hundreds of paying "students" and a user rating of 4.3/5. </p>
            <p>Tutoring will likely always be something that I engage in, on and off, throughout my career. It has always given me a sense of purpose and satisfaction to be a positive influence on someone's academic career, and I'm lucky enough to offer many students comfort in situations that they used to find stressful.</p>

            <h4 class="testimonial__subtitle">2017-2018... and Beyond!</h4>
            <p>After college, I paid off my debts and saved as much money as I could. Around the time of winter 2016, I learned about the "Pacific Crest Trail" (PCT) which is a ~2600mi trail on the U.S. west coast stretching from the CA-MEX border to the WA-CAN border. I began to be consumed by the idea of hiking the PCT to the point that not a day would go by without my thinking about it. It became clear to me that I had to make this dream a reality and in May 2017, after much preparation, I left my job at EchoStar and flew to San Diego, CA with my gear to start my hike. Over the next two months, I hiked almost 1,000 miles including hundreds of miles in the Mojave Desert and in the Sierra Nevada mountain range which included a summiting of Mt. Whitney. I had the time of my life.</p>
            <p> While I was off the trail, in a small CA town, I talked with a childhood friend who told me that his sister was getting married  soon in Taipei, Taiwan and that I was invited. I accepted his invitation, bought a ticket to Bangkok, Thailand, and traveled more-or-less solo around Asia for six weeks before everyone arrived for the wedding. After the wedding, I continued traveling. I went where the breeze took me, which included Thailand, northern and southern China, Japan, the Phillipnes, Hong Kong, and Taiwan... then South Africa and Mozambique... then Peru and Brazil! There were many ups and downs and everything in-between. I fell in love, swam in picturesque waters, got robbed of all my possessions, and the story goes on and on.</p>
            <p>After a whirlwind 12 months, I'm back in the U.S. to hunker down and immerse myself in web development. I realized somewhere along the way that I had much more fun in college developing webpages and webapps to host my course assignments than I did when I was working on embedded systems. Not just that, but while I was away from programming, nearly all of my software-related ideas came in the form of in-browser web-apps or web services which would be most efficiently implemented in JavaScript.</p>
            <p>I've been self-teaching for the majority of the calendar year. I am conversationally fluent in the language of modern web development, I'm continuing to work on little projects to enhance my understanding, and my software background has allowed me to reach this level of proficiency relatively quickly. Am I an expert? <strong>NO!</strong> But should you hire me anyway? <strong>YES!</strong> I'm dedicated to learning and I'm ready to join a team of developers who will catch me up to speed on their in-house tech stack -- and I'll be ready to make meaningful contributions in no time.</p>
